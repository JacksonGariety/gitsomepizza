I love [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) but not enough pizza I think. Part of the magic when switching from the default bash shell was playing with all the built themes. However, most of the themes were too noisy for me. I decided to ~~trim~~ pack in the fat and go ~~bare-bones~~ full-pizza with *some* pizza.


**Prompt Structure**

    directory (branch-name) üçï

This super simple prompt with some git:

  1. The current directory
  2. Current git branch name
  3. Git status on the current branch (red/green)


**Colors and formatting**

Gitsome now uses colors from [Jackson Gariety's](https://github.com/jacksongariety) awesome color scheme [Toy Chest Theme](https://github.com/jacksongariety/toy-chest-theme).

The typeface is [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro) from Adobe, set to 16pt for failing eyes.
