I love [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Part of the magic when switching from the default bash shell was playing with all the built themes. However, most of the themes were too noisy for me. I decided to trim the fat and go bare-bones with *some* git.


**Prompt Structure**

    [Directory(branch_name)]

This super simple prompt with some git:

  1. The current directory
  2. Current git branch name
  3. Git status on the current branch (red/green)


**Colors and formatting**

Gitsome now uses colors from [Ahmet SÃ¼lek's](https://github.com/ahmetsulek) awesome terminal color theme [Flat Terminal](https://github.com/ahmetsulek/flat-terminal). Red and green are slightly brighter because I prefer my terminal with a little bit of transparency. iTerm settings are included now.

The typeface is [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro) from Adobe, set to 16pt for failing eyes.
