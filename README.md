I love [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Part of the magic when switching from the default bash shell was playing with all the built themes. However, most of the themes were too noisy for me. I decided to trim the fat and go with a bare-bones with *some* git.


**Prompt Structure**

    [Directory(branch_name)]

**Features**

This super simple prompt with some git:
    1. The current directory
    2. Current git branch name
    3. Git status on the current branch

I would have contributed to the Oh-My-ZSH project directly, but it looks like its getting too crowded. That's all, feel free to improve or customize, cheers!
